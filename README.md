[00:12.05] When you look up at the night sky
[00:15.84] What do you see?
[00:17.78] The glowing beauty in the twilight
[00:21.43] It's no mystery
[00:28.93] 
[00:23.22] Now watch me set the scene, I'll light it all up
[00:26.24] When the time has come, I'll be rising high
[00:29.30] Longing for me like a lifeline
[00:32.98] Whenever you see
[00:40.98] 
[00:34.17] My shine
[00:38.93] I'll catch your eye
[00:48.43] 
[00:45.03] It's pulling you in like gravity
[00:48.22] You will be bowing on your knees, yeah
[00:51.11] Pulling you in, close to me
[00:54.09] Watch my glory and might
[01:06.09] 
[00:56.21] Following me like a high tide
[00:58.73] My reign will never stop
[01:01.67] The tide begins to rise up to the top
[01:05.75] Lеt my power ignite
[01:07.72] Following me likе a high tide (woah, oh)
[01:27.72] 
[01:17.33] I can be a bright enigma
[01:20.79] It's no surprise (it's no surprise, yeah)
[01:23.19] But you'll give in to the brilliance
[01:26.20] Like a moth to a light
[01:37.20] 
[01:28.43] Playing hard to get, but I ain't patient
[01:31.26] You'll succumb to my blinding radiance, yeah
[01:34.56] When you look up at the night sky
[01:38.29] What do you see?
[01:46.29] 
[01:39.22] My shine
[01:44.08] An effulgent sight
[01:53.08] 
[01:50.18] It's pulling you in like gravity
[01:53.36] You will be bowing on your knees, yeah
[01:56.13] Pulling you in, close to me
[01:59.03] Watch my glory and might
[02:11.03] 
[02:01.24] Following me like a high tide
[02:03.87] My reign will never stop
[02:06.75] The tide begins to rise up to the top
[02:10.70] Let my power ignite
[02:12.99] Following me like a high tide (woah, oh)
[02:18.64] Following me like a high tide (woah, oh)
[02:38.64] 
[02:25.06] I shine the brightest in the night
[02:32.10] The way the waves come nigh, oh, ah yeah
[02:52.10] 
[02:42.17] It's pulling you in like gravity
[02:45.38] You will be bowing on your knees, yeah
