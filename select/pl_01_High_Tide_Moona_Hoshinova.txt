When you look up
at the night sky
what do you see?
The glowing beauty
in the twilight
Its no mystery
Now watch me set the scene
I'll light it all up
When the time has come
I'll be rising high
Longing for me like a lifeline
whenever you see
my shine
I'll catch your eye
Its pulling you in
like gravity
you will be bowing
on your knees,
yeah
Pulling you in
close to me
Watch my glory and might
Following me like a high tide
My reign will never stop
The tide begins to rise up
to the top
Let my power ignite
Following me like a high tide
ooo ohh
I can be a bright enigma
Its no surprise
but you'll give in
to the brilliance
like a moth to a light
Playing hard to get
but I ain't patient
You'll succumb to my
blinding radiance yeah
When you look up
at the night sky
what do you see?
My shine!
an effulgent sight
Its pulling you in
like gravity
you will be bowing
on your knees,
yeah
Pulling you in
close to me
watch my glory and might
Following me like a high tide
My reign will never stop
the tide begins to rise up
to the top
Let my power ignite
Following me like a high tide
ooo ohh
Following me like a high tide
ooo ohh
I shine the brightest
in the night
the way the waves come nigh
ohh
Its pulling you in
like gravity
you will be bowing
on your knees,
yeah
Pulling you in
close to me
watch my glory and might
Following me like a high tide
My reign will never stop
the tide begins to rise up
to the top
Let my power ignite
Following me like a high tide
ooo ohh
Following me like a high tide
ooo ohh
