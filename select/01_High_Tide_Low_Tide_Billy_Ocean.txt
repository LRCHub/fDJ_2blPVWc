In high seas or in low seas
I'm gonna be your friend
I'm gonna be your friend

In high tide or low tide
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side

I heard her praying, praying, praying
I said, I heard my mother
She was praying, praying, praying, praying
And the words that she said
They still linger in my head
She said 'A child is born in this world
He needs protection'

God, guide and protect us
When we're wrong, please correct us
And stand by me, yeah

In high seas or in low seas
I'm gonna be your friend
He said, I'm gonna be your friend

And baby in high tide or low tide
I'll be by your side

And the tears that she shed (the tears that she shed)
They still linger in my head (lingers in my head)
She said, "A child is born in this world
He needs protection"
God, guide and protect us
When we're wrong (when we're wrong) correct us
And in high seas or low seas
I'm gonna be your friend
I'm gonna be your friend
Said He, "High tide or low tide
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side
Yeah, high seas or low seas
I'm gonna be your friend
I'm gonna be your friend
High tide or low tide
I'll be by your side"
