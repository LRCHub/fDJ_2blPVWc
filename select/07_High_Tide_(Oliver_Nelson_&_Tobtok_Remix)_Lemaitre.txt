You, you know i tried
You know i would lie.
You, you know i tried
You know i would lie.

And it might be worth a try.
So please, give me one more ride.
I'm stranded here, going nowhere.
Stuck ashore waiting for high tide

Now the tide is coming in
The heaven knows it didn't mean to sin
Trying hard to stay afloat
But drowned that shadow
Through the boat
Waves crashing in
From starboard side
Realize, I might have lost the fight
And the sea is way too rough
Looks like, I'm going into the abyss

But you know I know
You know I know
You know I know

You, you know I tried
You know, I would lie
You, you know i tried
You know, I would lie

And it might be worth the try
So please give me one last ride
I'm stranded here going nowhere
Stuck ashore waiting for high tide

There's been midnight sun
For ninety days
Waiting for the next lunar phase
No, I could see the crescent moon
Guess we'll be living in the present soon
Current pulled me out to sea
The tide it finally set me free

But you know I know
You know I know
You know I know

So please, give me one last ride
I'm stranded here going nowhere
Stuck ashore, waiting for high tide

But you know I know
You know I know
You know I know
