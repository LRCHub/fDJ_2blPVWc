I know that you have noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
Take a book and wash it away
No looking back, here comes a new day now
You all noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
That the book is washing away eh eh eh

Yo haven't you all noticed
That lifestyle is bogussed
Turn up my dp
And I keep my focus
No hocus pocus
No no magic
Till with the rill, even when its tragic
Pass it, been there many years so ready
Staying in the same game with my aim steady
You all cause pretty, I am about to sing my medley
Describe the beautiful, the ugly, the deadly
Anything else human be them, shoot the slaves mastering free them
Driving of in his brand new BM, Born to two things, seeing and mc-ing
Pleeying the scene and I don't like the way it looks
To many toes of businessmen, thumbs and crooks
Now it is too Rapshody, like modern day books
And newly come, you know how many days it took

I know that you have noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
Take a book and wash it away
No looking back, here comes a new day now
You all noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
That the book is washing away eh eh eh

Do you know what kind of budgets the military gets,
Cash fortune and size, who really gives a shit
Starting at a early age, playing with your boys
You should be 5 years old and having guns as toys
Now being programmed, I wish that I could say that I fear no men
But to unfear mankind, it is the man that ain't kind, cause you can't
Unwhine
Cause the totally destruction, is the way we shine
Cause we love confrontation, that is my only explanation
The fact that we keep recreating, the same situation, the same sensation
A bag with some angles, throughout these nations
Well come to hart of it, all you can do is become part of it
Like, fight the system, break the machine
A forbidden reality always starts with a dream

I know that you have noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
Take a book and wash it away
No looking back, here comes a new day now
You all noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
That the book is washing away eh eh eh

Only the educated want a revolution to come
With the budgets being cut, so there will be none
With every new crack, where the beat will outrun
It gets harder to get your information
Try to dumb us down, or lay their guns down
And the sound of a clap, becomes the soundtrack
To epocalypse, whow, the catch is rocking this
Or the catch is selling rocks to kids
To feed its pockets, haven't you all noticed how
Cash rules everything, dully still ruling
The harts of all the men, every time I really get the stand still
I think that you all noticed too all the suffering

I know that you have noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
Take a book and wash it away
No looking back, here comes a new day now
You all noticed How to empire re-spalling
Time to replace and time to quit stalling
That the book is washing away eh eh eh...
